  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>PoGoBag is an open source application that was inspired by a need for an easy and web-accessible application to view and share your Pok&eacutemon Go Pokemon. Trainer and Pok&eacute;mon data is updated whenever a user logs in, which means you can only see the pokemon of those who have logged in. For Google users, data is refreshed every 5 minutes (meaning only one login required to see your updated bag)</p>
  <p> PoGoBag is built with Ruby on Rails. <a href="https://github.com/dphuang2/PoGoBag">Github</a> </p>
